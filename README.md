# Codingquiz

These are the requirements of the Coding Quiz Assignment:
I am creating a quiz that starts with a button click. 
It includes a timer and multiple questions in a multiple
choice format.

Each time I answer a question another question is presented.

Incorrect answers subtract time from the timer. The quiz or game is over when the user answers all the questions or the timer reaches zero, whichever comes first.

Upon completion of the quiz I ca enter my initials and save the high score using local storage.

The code requires using multiple functions and at least 1 for loop.

I needed to work with the DOM to complete this assignment.
